# AI Engineering Studio — Full Build Plan

The complete implementation spec. `AGENTS.md` is the dense always-loaded context;
this file is the exhaustive marching orders. Read both before building content.

---

## 0. What this repo is, and the one rule that governs everything

A VitePress site teaching the AI engineering ecosystem **through a Solutions
Engineer / Solutions Architect lens.** The author is an SE/SA, not a deep AI
engineer — and that is the deliberate, defensible edge. The scarce skill in 2026
is the person who makes AI legible to a CTO and an engineer in the same meeting,
not the 500th deep-RAG tutorial.

**The governing rule for every page:** answer *what decision does this serve,
who is in the room, and how do I explain it.* Depth is in service of translation.

**The failure mode to avoid:** content that reads as "AI for people who can't be
bothered to learn AI." **The defense:** labs still build the real thing (you run
the RAG pipeline, write the eval, measure the latency); the translation layer is
*added on top*, never *substituted* for rigor.

Three reader goals, all in play: (1) share with SE/SA peers, (2) use at the
author's actual job, (3) portfolio showcase.

---

## 1. The four-layer ecosystem model

All content organizes under four layers the field has converged on:

| Layer | Name | Covers |
| --- | --- | --- |
| L1 | LLM apps & agents | RAG, agents, prompt/context engineering, evals, orchestration, MCP/A2A, multi-agent |
| L2 | LLMOps & inference infra | Serving (vLLM/SGLang), quantization, GPU, vector DBs, gateways, LLM observability, cost/latency |
| L3 | Classic MLOps & data | Training pipelines, feature stores, registries, experiment tracking, CI/CD for ML, drift |
| L4 | AI architecture & governance | Reference architectures, build-vs-buy, guardrails, evaluation strategy, NIST/EU AI Act/ISO 42001 |

Research-backed facts to use (cross-validated, 2026): agents are overwhelmingly
**hub-and-spoke orchestrator-worker** in production, not mesh/swarm; **MCP** (tools
for one agent) + **A2A** (agent-to-agent coordination) are the connective protocols;
RAG best practice is **hybrid search (BM25 + dense, RRF fusion) → rerank → top-5**;
**eval-as-a-production-gate** is the practice separating real work from demos;
inference standard is **vLLM/SGLang + quantization by default**; LLMOps is an
**extension of MLOps, not a replacement**; on architecture, **never build the model
layer, hybrid dominates** (buy foundation models + infra, build data layer +
task-specific agents). Mark all cost/latency/accuracy figures **illustrative**
unless verified against official docs.

---

## 2. The Depth Standard (apply per page, by tier)

Adapted from `solutions-playbook`'s DEPTH-STANDARD. The five moves:

1. **Worked scenario** — one concrete, named case end-to-end with a drawn mermaid flow.
2. **State the numbers** — real policy/values, or marked illustrative (`~1s`, `e.g. 1s→2s→4s`). Never invent an authoritative number.
3. **Failure path** — the flow shows happy path *and* failure, not just success.
4. **Talk track** — a `.sp-say` "Say it like this" box at each key decision: the literal sentence said on a call.
5. **Audience lens** — a "who sees what" view (eng / exec / customer) wherever relevant.

**Tiers** — what gets applied where:

| Tier | Folders | Moves |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A — Full | `lessons/`, `decision-frames/`, `visuals/` | All five |
| B — Partial | `poc-playbooks/`, `labs/`, `foundations/` | 1, 2, 4 (+3, +5 where relevant) |
| C — Lean (do not pad) | `talk-tracks/`, ADRs in `decisions/` | None — padding breaks their purpose |

---

## 3. The three-layer lab reading model (the defining lab convention)

Every lab is layered so three readers all get through it without one being lost
or the other being bored:

1. **Main track** — a generalist with general technical experience completes the
   lab front-to-back with no prior AI tooling knowledge. Gloss every new term in
   one plain line the first time it appears.
2. **`.ai-context` boxes** — inline notes explaining the *why* and customer
   relevance: what an SE would say about this step in a meeting.
3. **`.ai-deeper` anchors** — where engineering detail matters, link down to an
   "Under the hood" appendix or a linked lesson. Opt-in depth.
4. **`.ai-explain` close** — every lab ends not with "congratulations" but with
   *how you'd demo this to a customer* + the one-sentence non-technical version.

Example lab step (the texture to match):
> **Step 4 · Add a reranker.** Run `make rerank`. Your top-50 results get
> re-scored and cut to the best 5.
> `.ai-context`: "This is the cheapest quality win in RAG — to a customer it's
> 'we double-check the search results before the AI reads them.'"
> `.ai-deeper`: → Under the hood: cross-encoders vs bi-encoders · Lesson: RAG retrieval decisions

Lab anatomy (from `devops-studio`): one Makefile, quick start, detailed setup,
project structure, troubleshooting, cleanup, cost note (almost always `$0`),
next steps — **plus** the three-layer reading model on top.

---

## 4. Component classes (in `.vitepress/theme/custom.css` — already created)

Use these; never hardcode hex (breaks dark mode).

- `.sp-say` + `.sp-label` — talk-track box. `<div class="sp-say"><div class="sp-label">Say it like this</div><p>"..."</p></div>`
- `.sp-band` + `.sp-step` (`.sp-h`/`.sp-d`) — scenario step band.
- `.sp-pill` (`.ok`/`.warn`/`.bad`) — inline status tags, e.g. `<span class="sp-pill warn">429</span>`.
- `.ai-context` + `.ai-label` — SE relevance note (the lab's translation layer).
- `.ai-deeper` + `.ai-label` — go-deeper pointer to appendix/lesson.
- `.ai-explain` + `.ai-label` — the "explain it to a customer" lab close.

---

## 5. Canonical cast (reuse so the repo reads authored, not assembled)

Create `CANONICAL-CAST.md` documenting these. Vendor-neutral as *categories*,
concrete as *examples*. Keep tool names isolated here so a swap is one edit.

| Category | Example used |
| --- | --- |
| Local serving | Ollama + Llama 3.x 8B |
| Embeddings | bge / nomic-embed |
| Vector DB | Qdrant |
| Tracing / observability | Langfuse |
| Eval | promptfoo / DeepEval (+ RAGAS for RAG) |
| Orchestration | **LangGraph** (the standard — ADR 001) |
| Model gateway | LiteLLM |
| Production serving (lessons) | vLLM / SGLang |

**Whenever you add a page, add its link to the sidebar/nav in
`.vitepress/config.mts`** or the build fails on the dead link. Conversely, the
config currently lists target pages that don't exist yet — create them (or
temporarily remove the link) so the build is green at each commit.

---

## 7. Build plan — per-deliverable branches & PRs (dead-link CI gate)

**Workflow (current, see `CONTRIBUTING.md`):** PR **per deliverable**. A **lab is
always its own branch + PR**; signature artifacts are too, unless a few are small
and tightly related (the Phase 1 spine was the one allowed grouping). "Phase" is a
roadmap label/wave, **not** a PR unit. Branch naming: `phase-N/<deliverable-slug>`
(e.g. `phase-2/lab-01-first-llm-app`). Commit often inside the branch; preserve
commits on merge (no squashing a deliverable); keep `main` green after every merge.
Phase 0 landed directly on `main` (scaffold exception only).

Each row below is one branch → one PR. Check off as merged.

### Phase 0 — Scaffold + standards + on-ramp  ✅ DONE (on `main`)
Scaffold, violet theme, Node-20 dead-link CI, home, git hooks, `AGENTS.md`,
`START-HERE.md`, `DEPTH-STANDARD.md`, `CANONICAL-CAST.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, and
the 4 `foundations/` pages incl. `langgraph-how-to.md`.

### Phase 1 — The SE/SA spine  ✅ DONE (PR #3, one grouped PR — the allowed exception)
POC playbook, 3 decision frames (`managed-vs-self-host`, `rag-tco`,
`do-we-need-an-agent`), talk track (`explaining-a-hallucination`), four-layer
visual, ADR 001. Plus the visuals system + mermaid fix (PR #4).

### Phase 2 — Apps & agents, hands-on & anchored  (~2–3 wk) — IN PROGRESS
All labs are **provider-agnostic** (Ollama default + hosted free-tier fallback; see
`labs/model-backends.md` and the §3 lab note). One branch/PR each:
- [x] `phase-2/lab-01-first-llm-app` — streaming CLI + function calling. Done (PR #8), then made provider-agnostic. Includes `labs/index.md` + `labs/model-backends.md`.
- [x] `phase-2/lab-02-production-rag` — hybrid (BM25+dense, RRF) → fastembed rerank → grounded answer + a lightweight eval gate. Embedded Qdrant. Done; smoke-tested. (Full RAGAS-style eval deferred to Lab 04.)
- [x] `phase-2/lab-03-agent-system` — hub-and-spoke orchestrator-worker (LangGraph) + one real MCP tool. Done; smoke-tested (agent routed to the MCP tool end-to-end).
- [x] `phase-2/apps-agents-lessons` — RAG patterns, agent architectures, context engineering, MCP/A2A, + lessons index. Done. **Phase 2 complete.**

Each lab uses the three-layer reading model; `.ai-explain` close links to a talk track.

### Phase 3 — Evals + cost made legible  (~1–2 wk)
- [ ] `phase-3/lab-04-eval-harness` — LLM-as-judge + regression gate in CI.
- [ ] `phase-3/frame-good-enough` — "how do we know it's good enough?" decision frame.
- [ ] `phase-3/lab-05-serving-and-cost` — Ollama/quantization tradeoffs, measured latency/cost.
- [ ] `phase-3/frame-cost-at-scale` — "what will this cost at scale?" decision frame.

### Phase 4 — Architecture, governance & the MLOps bridge  (~1–2 wk)
Mostly lessons + visuals; group small related lessons, split large ones:
- [ ] `phase-4/lesson-reference-architectures`
- [ ] `phase-4/lesson-guardrails-and-governance` — NIST / EU AI Act / ISO 42001 in plain English.
- [ ] `phase-4/lesson-mlops-llmops-bridge` — cross-links to `devops-studio`.
- [ ] `phase-4/visuals-governance` — `governance-stack` (+ any L4 visuals).

### Phase 5 — Capstone, observability & trilogy polish  (~1–2 wk)
- [ ] `phase-5/lab-06-observability` — Langfuse tracing + cost.
- [ ] `phase-5/lab-07-capstone` — end-to-end RAG-agent app; **two tracks: strictly-$0 local AND optional rented-GPU cloud** (never force spend).
- [ ] `phase-5/learning-paths` — role-based paths + trilogy cross-links.
- [ ] `phase-5/qa-pass` — full depth-standard QA + link check. Exit: portfolio-ready, trilogy complete.

## 8. Learning paths (build as a page in Phase 5)

| Path | For | Sequence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SE/SA entering AI (flagship) | People like the author | foundations → decision-frames → POC playbook → Labs 01–02 → talk tracks |
| In a live AI deal | Work, right now | START-HERE → talk track → matching decision frame → demo script |
| Get hands dirty | Build credibility | Labs 01 → 02 → 04 → 03, anchors followed as desired |
| From DevOps to AI | The crossover | MLOps↔LLMOps bridge → infra lessons → governance (links to devops-studio) |

---

## 9. Git & PR workflow

- Plain single-author commits; `commit-msg` hook rejects co-author/generation
  trailers. Imperative subject, no trailing period, body only when "why" is non-obvious.
- PR-per-deliverable. Squash-merge to `main`. Invest polish in PR titles — they
  become the permanent history (e.g. "Lab 02 · Production RAG", "POC Playbook · Scoping an AI POC").
- Dead-link CI (`npm run docs:build`) is a required check.
- Phase 0's first scaffold can land directly on `main`; everything after branches.
- Remote `origin` = https://github.com/WBHankins93/ai-engineering-studio (empty).
  Push needs authenticated GitHub access — connect the engineering GitHub MCP or
  run an authenticated push manually. Build PR-groupings locally meanwhile.

## 10. Before finishing any content page — checklist
- [ ] Correct tier identified; only the required depth moves applied (don't pad Tier C).
- [ ] Page link added to `.vitepress/config.mts` sidebar/nav.
- [ ] `npm run docs:build` passes (no dead links).
- [ ] Numbers stated or marked illustrative — none invented as authoritative.
- [ ] Talk tracks in the author's voice (warm, direct, outcome-first, one clean line).
- [ ] Mermaid labels short, single-line, strict-mode safe.
- [ ] Canonical cast used for any tool reference.
- [ ] For labs: main track is generalist-completable; `.ai-context`/`.ai-deeper`/`.ai-explain` present.
